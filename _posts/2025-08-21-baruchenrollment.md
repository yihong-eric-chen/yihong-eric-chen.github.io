I am thrilled to announce that I will be joining the Zicklin School of Business at Baruch College, City University of New York, as a PhD student in Information Systems starting Fall 2025!

This marks an exciting new chapter in my academic journey. I look forward to working with distinguished faculty and fellow researchers at Baruch, and to deepening my expertise in the field of Information Systems. My research interests include human-AI interaction, cybersecurity, and the societal impact of emerging technologies.

Thank you to everyone who has supported me along the wayâ€”mentors, colleagues, friends, and family. I am eager to embark on this new adventure and contribute to the vibrant research community at Baruch College.

Stay tuned for updates on my research and experiences in New York City!
