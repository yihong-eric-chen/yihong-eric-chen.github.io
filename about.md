Hello, my name is Yihong (Eric) Chen (陈羿泓). Currently, I am a PhD student in Information Systems at the [Zicklin School of Business, Baruch College – CUNY](https://zicklin.baruch.cuny.edu). I completed my undergraduate studies at the [University of Delaware](https://lerner.udel.edu), majoring in Management Information Systems, Mathematics, and Data Science. I was also part of the Joint Educational Institute (JEI) at the [SWUFE-UD Institute of Data Science](https://dids.swufe.edu.cn) in Chengdu, China.

I aspire to become a researcher and educator in a business school. My [research](/research.md) focuses on understanding the impact of technology on society. To date, my research projects have secured over $10,000 in funding, and I have presented my work at notable MIS conferences such as [CNAIS](https://cnais.sem.tsinghua.edu.cn/index.htm) and [WITS](https://witsconf.org). I was an Undergraduate Research Scholar under the mentorship of Professor Harry Wang, we utilized large language models (LLMs) to analyze business research papers. Currently, I work as a part-time research assistant with Professor Leting Zhang, where I focus on privacy and cybersecurity using text mining and econometric methods. I am also involved in several interdisciplinary data science projects focusing on social good computing.

In my professional experience, I have contributed to the development of Generative AI systems at [Takin.AI](https://takin.ai) and [HiddenArt.AI](https://hiddenart.ai). During my tenure as an algorithm engineer intern at [China Telecom](http://www.ffcs.cn), I gained hands-on experience in natural language processing (NLP) and AI model training.

Outside of academics, I was a UD Student Alumni Ambassador ([UDSAA](https://www.udel.edu/alumni-friends/connect/students/student-alumni-ambassadors/)) and the former president of the SWUFE Fujian Fellows Association. These roles have helped me refine my leadership and event coordination skills. For more details, please refer to my [CV](/cv.md).

In my free time, I enjoy music and movies. I served as the principal horn player for the SWUFE Symphony Orchestra and am an avid fan of Chinese folk music and traditional songs.
