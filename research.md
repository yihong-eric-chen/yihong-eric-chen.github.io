### Human-AI Interaction

- **Can Large Language Models Simulate Human Behavior in Disaster Scenarios?**  
  **Funding:** National Science Foundation REU Site, July 2024 - Present, $3,500<br>
  **Supervisor:** Prof. Shangjia Dong at Disaster Research Center, UD  
  **Stage:** Drafting
  **Description:** This project examines whether large language models (LLMs) can emulate human-like decision-making behavior in disaster scenarios by combining novel AI technology with widely accepted theoretical frameworks like the Protective Action Decision Model (PADM).  
  **Collaborator:** Xiao Qian<br>
